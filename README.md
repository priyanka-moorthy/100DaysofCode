## Day 1 : Reverse Integer
  Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

  Note:
  Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this      problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
  
## Day 2 : Palindrome Number
  Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

  Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
